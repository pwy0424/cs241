<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
	More and more programs today are being programmed as
	multithreaded applications.  The goal of this MP is to give
	you more practice writing multithreaded applications and to
	expose common pitfalls that occur while designing a program to
	work in a parallel manner. Additionally, you will need to make
	use of synchronization primitives to protect memory shared
	amongst the threads.
</p>
<p>
	You are tasked with writing an application which will imitate
	the common make utility.  We have provided a parse function
	which will list dependencies and commands to run for different
	target values.  You will need to use this parse function to
	store the work that needs to be done.  Then using a fixed pool
	of threads, you will make sure that all commands are executed
	after their dependencies.  When there is less work to be done
	than there are threads, the remaining idle threads should
	sleep.
</p>
<p>
	Before starting you should read
	the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Wikipedia
	article on Make</a>.
</p>

<h2>TASKS</h2>
<h4>[Part 1]</h4> The first thing you will need to do is to parse the
	given command-line options.  All handling of options should be
	done
	using <tt><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/getopt">getopt()</a></tt>.
	This function will allow you to specify which options are
	valid and which require arguments.  The usage for parmake
	looks like:
	<blockquote>
	parmake [ -f makefile ] [ -j threads ] [ targets ]
	</blockquote>
	If a makefile is not specified, <tt>./makefile</tt>
	or <tt>./Makefile</tt> should be used in that order, if they
	exist
	(see <tt><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/access">access()</a></tt>). Return
	a non-zero value if neither of these files exist. If the
	number of worker threads -j is not specified, the default
	value of 1 should be used.  The j worker threads are in
	addition to the one main thread.  The space seperated list of
	targets will always come last and is optional. You will need
	to save any targets given for use in Part 2. The man page
	for <tt><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/getopt">getopt()</a></tt>
	shows an example of how to locate the position of targets
	within argc.

<h4>[Part 2]</h4>
<p>
	Next, the main thread should parse the makefile.  The makefile
	will always consist of one or more rules of the form:
	<blockquote>
		target [target ...]: [dependency ...]<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[command 1]<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[command n]<br />
	</blockquote>
	For example:
	<blockquote>
	rule1: rule2 rule3<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandtoberun withargs<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandtoberun2 withargs<br />
	rule2:<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;othercommand <br />
	rule3 rule4:<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finalcommand <br />
	</blockquote>
	If you are unfamiliar with the syntax do not be afraid.  We
	have provided you with a parsing
	function, <a href="parser_8h.html">parser_parse_makefile()</a>.
</p>
<p>
	When invoking the parser you will have to provide "call-back"
	functions and the list of targets from Part 1.  This means you
	will have to pass function pointers of the type defined in
	parser.h.  These callback functions will be called
	from <tt>parser_parse_makefile()</tt> providing you with the
	parsed strings.  For dependencies and commands, the target to
	which the dependency or command belongs is also passed back.
</p>
<p>
	The list of targets should be a NULL-terminated array of
	strings similar to that of argv.  The targets are used by the
	parser to select the correct rules (for example 'make clean'
	only runs the clean target).  If no targets are given on the
	command line, the list of targets will only include the
	terminating NULL pointer.  Those curious of the implementation
	can view the source in parser.c although this is not necessary
	for a functioning MP.
</p>
<p> We have provided an implementation of a queue for you to store
	rules.  It can be viewed
	in <a href="queue_8h.html">queue.h</a>.
</p>
<h4>[Part 3]</h4>
<p>
    Once all the rules have been parsed, you will want to decide what
    rules should run.  There are a few simple rules to follow:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A rule cannot be run unless all of its dependencies have been
    met.</li>
    <li>Every dependency is either the name of another rule or a name
    of a file on disk.</li>

    <li>
        If the dependency is the name of a rule:
        <ul>
            <li>The rule that the dependency depends on must be ran
            first.</li>
            <li>Only once the dependency that the rule depends on
            finishes running all of its commands should a dependency
            be considered met.</li>
            <li>If the rule has no dependencies, it's ready to be
            ran.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        If the dependency is <b>NOT a rule</b>, then it MUST be a file
        on disk. <i>(We will not test cases where this is not
        true.)</i>  In this case:
        <ul>
            <li>
                If <b>EVERY</b> dependency for a rule are names of
                files on disk (that is, none of them are names of
                other rules):
                <ul>
                    <li>If the name of the rule does not exist as a
                    file on disk
                    (using <tt><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/access">access()</a></tt>): <span style="color:
                    darkgreen;"><b>RUN</b></span> the rule.</li>
                    <li>
                        If the name of the rule does exist as a file
                        on disk:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check the modification time of the
                            rule file
                            (using <tt><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/stat">stat()</a></tt>).</li>
                            <li>Check the modification times of all
                            the dependency files.</li>
                            <li>
                                If the modification time of the rule
                                file is NEWER (more recent) than the
                                modification time of ALL the
                                dependencies, <span style="color:
                                darkred;"><b>DO NOT RUN</b></span> run
                                the rule.  If this rule was a
                                dependency to another rule, you should
                                consider this dependency met (even
                                though you ran nothing).
                            </li>
                            <li>If ANY dependency has a newer
                            modification time, <span style="color:
                            darkgreen;"><b>RUN</b></span> the
                            rule.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                If any of the dependencies are rules (even if some are
                only files on disk): <span style="color:
                darkgreen;"><b>RUN</b></span> the rule.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        To run a rule:
        <ul>
            <li>Run each command in the order they were listed in the
            makefile. (You should
            use <tt><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/system">system()</a></tt>
            for this; you can choose to <tt>printf()</tt> what you're
            about to run but it isn't necessary.)</li>
            <li>
                Check the return value after each command finishes.
                If the return value was zero (success), continue
                running.  If the return value was non-zero (failure),
                exit your entire program with a return value of 1.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you exit due to a failed command, it is not
                    necessary to free all your memory.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Once all commands have ran for a rule, this rule is
                completed.  If it was a dependency to another rule,
                this dependency has been met (which may cause other
                rules to be able to run).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>For your convenience these rules are captured in the following flow chart:</p>
<img src="flow.png"/>


<h4>[Part 4]</h4>

	<p>
	The number of threads running rules is given as the
	command-line option -j.  Each worker thread will be in charge
	of processing rules.  This consists of determining whether its
	dependencies have been fulfilled and then executing any
	associated commands.  There are several important concurrency
	requirements:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You should NOT make any rule unless its
		dependencies have been met (all dependent rules have
		been run, see the previous section)</li>

		<li>If there exists <tt>J</tt> rules with all
		dependencies met and <tt>T</tt> threads
		where <tt>J&gt;=T</tt>, NO threads should be
		sleeping</li>

		<li>If there exists <tt>J</tt> rules with all
		dependencies met and <tt>T</tt> threads
		where <tt>J&lt;T</tt>, <tt>T-J</tt> threads should be
		sleeping</li>
	</ul>
<p>
    <i>...that is, every thread should be as busy as possible
    processing rules if there is work to be done.</i>
</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p> You can assume all makefiles will be in valid Makefile
		style syntax as described previously as well as have
		no circular dependencies.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><p> Reordering rules that may be run at the same time to
		achieve global optimal efficiency is not required.
		The dependency graph might have natural choke points
		where one task limits all the others.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><p> You will receive 0 points if your implementation
		uses <tt>sleep()</tt> or busy waiting.
	</p></li>
	<li><p> You must only ever launch <tt>T</tt> threads.  Do not
		keep re-spawning new threads for every rule.
	</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>TEST FILES</h2>
<p>
    We have provided you with six test files for you.  You can find
    the expected output by running them with GNU &quot;make&quot;,
    which follows the same rules as your program.  If you choose not
    to <tt>printf()</tt> the commands you are going to run, your
    output will match <tt>make -s</tt>.
</p>



<h2>COMPILING AND RUNNING</h2>

<p>To compile, run the following commands from a command prompt on
a Linux machine:</p>

<blockquote>
   %&gt; make clean <br />
   %&gt; make
</blockquote>

<p>To run the executable,</p>
<blockquote>
	%&gt; ./parmake [ -f makefile ] [ -j threads] [ targets ]
</blockquote>

<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
	%&gt; ./parmake -f testfile4 -j 2
</blockquote>

<p>This should generate the same output as:</p>
<blockquote>
	%&gt; make -f testfile4 -j 2<br />
    &nbsp;=== OR ===<br />
	%&gt; make -s -f testfile4 -j 2
</blockquote>
